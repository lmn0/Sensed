This is a multi-tenent sensor cloud system. The sensor cloud enables users to add their sensor data to the cloud system thus allowing them to monitor the data in form of charts and other dashboards. 

The dashboard provides analytical information regarding the data that was collected. The user can then make sound choices about making changes to the environmental values such as reducing temperature or pressure that a sensor is exposed to.

The project was a collaborative effort with help from team mates from the university - SJSU.
